**IPro 497 – Product Direction Document**

**Problem Statement**

1. College Students often sign up for classes without having an idea what that class deals with. Not knowing how to study for the course or understanding certain materials within the course can lead students to suffer grade-wise due to the time it can take to figure that out. With some professors, by the time you figure it out: it's too late. 
2. Professors and administrators need to deal with many college students signing up for classes which they drop after finding out that the class isn't a proper fit for them. In a lot of scenarios, another section or another class entirely is more fitting towards certain students and by the time the students figure it out they are stuck in a section that is tough for them.

**Top Two to Three Scenarios**

### Student
Scenario #1

Kivtur is entering his last semester as an undergraduate student and wants to finish his degree off with easy classes. Registration period is coming up, and he knows what requirements he has to satisfy and uses our application to ask what are the best classes to take, and which professors to take it with. He would then get replies from alumni or students that have already taken it who would explain what to express from the class. Now jaR doesn&#39;t have to worry about being in a class where the work is unexpected.

Scenario #2

jaR is a student that has taken a bunch of classes already and doesn&#39;t mind helping out students that are about to enroll. He decides that he&#39;ll log on to (WEBSITE) and advise jaR about taking PSYC 301 with professor X rather than with professor Y because professor X has easier exams. He also tells jaR that if he needs any help to ask him. This lets jaR choose a course that he is most prepared for, and he doesn&#39;t need to stress too much during registration.
### Professor

Scenario #1
	Professor Good is teaching 4 classes in the upcoming semester, and he has been let known by past students that his courses are harder than the students expected. Some students have also made a point that the class isn’t what it seems based on the IIT course catalog. Professor Good keeps this in mind and decides to navigate to his section of the variety of courses he is going to teach on the Insider Platform application. There he describes the course, what students need to know to succeed, and he posts the syllabus to the course from a past semester.

Scenario #2
	Professor Good knows that registration week is starting and that he is about to be teaching a course that usually is taken by 50+ students. He decides that he will take the time to answer questions that students have left on his page. Here he can make sure that he is doing his part in showing what his course is about so that students in the upcoming semester are not surprised by course content.
