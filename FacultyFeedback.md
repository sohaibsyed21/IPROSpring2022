# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

## Week 9 ##
- Look at the PDD and the scenarios there and make sure they represented on the board 
- Figure out what can you get done in four weeks after spring break
- If you were to define what you'll get done in the  four weeks after spring break in two to three sentences what would it be?
- You have a huge head start and working software starting the course.  You have reduced technical debt with your changes, so now deliver new capabilities.

- You want to ensure that you are full screen and presentation mode in the presentation software
- IIT only?  Is your customer only IIT or is IIT college students your first audience?
- I like your persona and the "talk track" for the personas
- I like the fact that you have a grad and ungrad student
- Think about transitions from one slide to another like - "Now, <person name> will be covering scenario 1"
- Good tie in from personas to the same "personas" in the scenarios
- What is AAH?  Mention its an architecture course
- There doesn't seem to be a specific user awareness (e.g., a login)
- Don't reuse last terms "do differently" - given what you did quarter what we do differently
